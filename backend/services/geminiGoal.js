      IMPORTANT: Carefully analyze the provided user data including their financial background, 
      current savings, investments, income, expenses, and stated goals.
      
      Based on this analysis, provide:
      
      1. Percentage completion of Short-term goals (1-3 year goals) - Compare current savings/investments 
         against short-term targets mentioned in the data
      
      2. Percentage completion of Long-term goals (retirement/long-term wealth) - Evaluate progress toward 
         retirement or other long-term financial goals
      
      3. The estimated amount of money (in INR) still needed to complete their Short-term goals
      
      4. The estimated amount of money (in INR) still needed to complete their Long-term goals
         
      Consider factors like:
      - Current savings relative to stated goals
      - Investment portfolio alignment with goals
      - Income vs. expenses and saving rate
      - Debt levels and repayment progress
      - Age and time horizon
      
      Even if some data is missing, provide your best reasonable estimate based on available information.
      DO NOT return 0% unless the user truly has made no progress. Provide realistic percentages.
      For the monetary amounts, provide specific INR amounts (e.g., "Rs. 25,000").
